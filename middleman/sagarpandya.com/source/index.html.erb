  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I am a graduate from UCSB (computer engineering, 2009) and USC (computer science, 2012). I'm curious about most things. I like stories, especially in musical form. At night, I become easily distracted by the sky. In my spare time, I like to read and get stressed out about how much there is to learn in the world. </p>
